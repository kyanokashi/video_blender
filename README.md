# video_generator

Video blending python script optimized for large batches and to apply blendomes. 
I created this script to help generate a batch of 10k videos composed of three layers each with various blendmodes.
I used multiprocessing and openCV to achieve max optimization, speed, and quality.

Run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to download necessary packages.
