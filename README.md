# video_generator

Video blending python script optimized to blend large batches of video layer through multiply and softlight blendmodes. 
I created this script to generate a batch of 10k videos composed of three layers for a well known creative agency.
I used multiprocessing and openCV to achieve max optimization, speed, and quality.

Run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to download necessary packages.
